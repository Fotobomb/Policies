## 6) Location, Permissions & Notifications

## 8) Content You Upload (Licence)

You keep ownership of the photos, text, and media you upload (**“Content”**).

By submitting Content, you grant Fotobomb a **non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free licence** to host, store, reproduce, adapt (e.g., resize/crop/compress), distribute, and publicly display your Content for the purposes of operating, improving, and promoting the Service (including within the app, on the website, and on official Fotobomb social channels).

- Your Content is lawful and does not infringe intellectual property, privacy, or other rights.

### Removal & backups

- If you delete Content (or request deletion), we will stop using it for new uses within a reasonable period.
- Residual copies may remain temporarily in caches, backups, or where content has already been shared publicly (e.g., a prior social post), to the extent permitted by law.

Privacy Policy
Introduction
Fotobomb is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your personal data when using our application.

Information We Collect
Personal Data
When using Fotobomb, we may collect personal information such as your name and email address for both enthusiasts and photographers; as well as social media links, business name, and location-sharing preferences if you are a photographer.

Location Data
To enable location-based features, such as notifying users when they are near other photographers, Fotobomb may temporarily access your location in the background. This background location data is used only to support app functionality (e.g., proximity notifications) and is not stored or retained after use. Users have full control over whether to share their location and may enable or disable this feature in their device settings at any time.

Usage Data
We may collect data on how you use the app, such as interactions with features and preferences, to improve user experience. This data helps us understand what features are most valuable and where improvements can be made.

Permissions Used by the App
Fotobomb requires the following Android permissions in order to provide essential features. All permissions are used responsibly and solely to enhance user experience and core app functionality:

ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION & ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION
Used to determine your precise or approximate location to show nearby photographers and enable location-based features.

ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION
Allows the app to access your location while it is running in the background, so proximity-based notifications work even when the app isn't actively open. You can disable this at any time in your device settings.

FOREGROUND_SERVICE & FOREGROUND_SERVICE_LOCATION
Enables location-based services to run in the foreground (such as real-time proximity features) without interrupting the user experience.

INTERNET
Required to allow the app to connect to our servers, retrieve user data, share media, and load maps or other dynamic features.

READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE & WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
These permissions allow users to upload images from their device or save media. For example, photographers may upload car photos, and users can save images from the app to their device.

All permissions are requested clearly during app use. You can revoke or manage them through your device’s system settings at any time.

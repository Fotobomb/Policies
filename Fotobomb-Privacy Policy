# Fotobomb Privacy Policy

**Effective:** 9 Feb 2026  
**Version:** 2.0

We respect your privacy. This policy explains what we collect, how we use it, and your choices under the **UK GDPR** and the **Data Protection Act 2018**. Where EU law applies (for example, if you are in the EEA), this policy is also intended to meet EU GDPR requirements.

---

## 1) Who We Are (Data Controller)

Fotobomb is operated from Wales, United Kingdom. For the purposes of the UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018, the Fotobomb operator(s) are the data controller responsible for your personal data.

**Contact:** Use the in-app support section (Fotobombadvertising@gmail.com).

---

## 2) Information We Collect

### Account & profile information
- Name, email address, and authentication identifiers
- Profile details you choose to provide (e.g., display name, business name, social links, profile type)
- Content you upload (photos, descriptions, location listings)

### Location data
Location is used to provide map features and nearby functionality while the app is in use. If you enable background location, location may be processed in the background to support features such as alerts. You can control permissions at any time in your device settings.

We do not aim to store a continuous “location history” of your movements. However, some location-related data (such as a listing you create, or your chosen “share location” status if you are a Photographer) may be stored as part of providing the Service.

### Purchase information
Purchases and subscriptions are processed by Google Play. We receive entitlement and transaction verification data needed to provide purchases (for example, whether ad removal is active). We do not receive your full payment card details.

### Device, usage & diagnostics
- Device information (model, OS version, app version, language)
- App activity/usage data and performance diagnostics
- Log and crash data to help fix bugs and improve reliability

---

## 3) Permissions the App Uses

- **Location (fine/coarse, foreground/background):** map features, proximity/nearby functions
- **Notifications:** service alerts and updates (where enabled)
- **Foreground service:** to run essential background tasks where needed
- **Internet:** authentication, maps, syncing, subscriptions, ads
- **Photos/Media/Storage:** to upload or save media you choose to share

You can manage or revoke permissions at any time via device settings.

---

## 4) How We Use Your Data

We use data to:

- Provide the Service (accounts, profiles, maps, listings, and uploads)
- Enable location-based features (including Photographer location sharing when you choose to enable it)
- Verify and manage subscriptions/entitlements (e.g., ad removal)
- Display ads (unless removed) and measure ad performance
- Maintain security, prevent fraud/abuse, and enforce our Terms
- Improve performance, reliability, and user experience
- Send essential service messages (and marketing only where you have consented, if applicable)

### Legal bases for processing
- **Contract:** to provide the Service you request (account, features, subscriptions)
- **Consent:** for optional features like background location and notifications (you can withdraw any time)
- **Legitimate interests:** service security, fraud prevention, analytics to improve performance (balanced against your rights)
- **Legal obligation:** where we must retain certain records (e.g., accounting/tax)

---

## 5) Advertising, Analytics & Third Parties

We use third-party service providers to operate the app. Depending on your settings, these providers may process personal data on our behalf:

- **Google Firebase** (authentication, databases, storage, analytics, crash reporting)
- **Google Maps** (map display and related features)
- **Google Play Billing** (subscriptions and purchase processing)
- **Google AdMob** (advertising, unless removed)

You can control ad personalisation via your device settings or Google account settings. If you disable personalisation, you may still see non-personalised ads. We do not knowingly serve personalised ads to children under 13.

---

## 6) Sharing of Data

We may share data:

- With service providers who help us run the app (as described above)
- If required by law, court order, or to respond to valid legal process
- To protect rights, safety, and security of users, the public, or the Service
- In connection with a reorganisation, sale, or transfer of the Service (subject to appropriate safeguards)

---

## 7) International Transfers

Some of our service providers may process data outside the UK (and outside the EEA). Where this happens, we use appropriate safeguards such as the UK International Data Transfer Agreement or Standard Contractual Clauses, as applicable.

---

## 8) Security

We use appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect personal data. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

---

## 9) Retention

We keep personal data only as long as necessary to provide the Service and for legitimate business or legal purposes. For example, we may retain certain records to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce agreements.

---

## 10) Your Rights

Under UK GDPR (and EU GDPR where applicable), you may have the right to:

- Request access to your personal data
- Request correction of inaccurate or incomplete data
- Request deletion of your data
- Request restriction of processing
- Object to processing (including processing based on legitimate interests)
- Request data portability (in certain circumstances)
- Withdraw consent at any time (where we rely on consent)

To exercise your rights, contact us via in-app support. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the **Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO)** if you believe your data rights have been infringed.

---

## 11) Children’s Privacy

Users under 13 require parent/guardian consent. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13 without such consent. If we learn we have collected data without appropriate consent, we will take steps to delete it.

---

## 12) Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will provide notice of material changes within the app or by other reasonable means. The “Effective” date above shows when this policy was last updated.
